# SpineOpt_Backbone_Comparison
Comparing SpineOpt and Backbone on a 6-unit system


- This repository contains results of translation of a 6-unit system from Backbone to SpineOpt. The aim is to make it easier to understand the similarities and differences between the data formats of the two models, for possible translations between them, or from a generic data format to each of them.
- You will be able to find different steps of progression of this translation in the Spine-Toolbox project, from a small 2-unit system to the full 6-unit system.
- Every of these systems goes with an small comparison workflow between the SpineOpt system and the Backbone system. In particular, there is a first code to handle the format of results from Backbone, and compare them to SpineOpt's results.
- In the word document "Notes_Translation_Backbone_SpineOpt.docx" you will be able to find more precisions on the system, observations on the differences between SpineOpt and Backbone and some conclusions about them.

Side note: the Spine-Toolbox project uses Backbone. A valid licence is required to use it.
